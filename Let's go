Basic Codes:

CODE:var
USING FOR:Create variable and they can changeable.
EXAMPLE:fun main(){ var olgun = 18}

CODE:let
USING FOR:Create variable but they can't change.
EXAMPLE:fun main(){ let olgun = 18}

CODE://
USING FOR:Comment the line you are using.
EXAMPLE://fun main(){ var olgun = 18  
                            print(olgun)  }
This code is not working because double slash is commenting its own line
